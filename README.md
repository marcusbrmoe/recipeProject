# Fullstack Recipe Application

## Description
This project was created by Marcus Moe as a part of the Server Programming course.
Backend code is the main focus of the application and therefore the frontend is very simple. The application's purpose is to provide CRUD functionality regarding recipes. Other functionalities like login, password reset, sign up, and (simple) REST API endpoints can also be found in the application. Administrators will have full access to the CRUD functionalities, while "normal" users only have some functionalities available. 

A live version of the application can be found [here](https://marcusrecipeproject.herokuapp.com/login).
